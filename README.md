# Metasploitable-2-Risk-Assessment-and-Mitigation

## Objective

The Metasploitable 2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation project aimed to identify, evaluate, and address vulnerabilities within the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. The primary focus was to simulate a real-world penetration test, analyze risks, and implement effective security measures. This project serves as a demonstration of my cybersecurity skills, following the ISO 27001 framework, and is intended to showcase my ability to protect information assets and enhance security postures.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in conducting penetration tests and identifying vulnerabilities.
- Advanced understanding of risk assessment methodologies.
- Ability to analyze and interpret vulnerability reports.
- Development of mitigation and risk treatment plans.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Application of ISO 27001 standards in a practical context.
- Improved documentation and reporting skills for cybersecurity projects.

### Tools Used

- Nmap for network scanning and service enumeration.
- Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities and simulating attacks.
- CVE databases (such as CVE.mitre.org) for identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities.
- Text editors and documentation tools for reporting findings and mitigation plans.

## Steps

### Step 1: Initial Scanning and Enumeration

- **Skills Gained**: Network scanning, service enumeration, initial vulnerability identification.
- **Outcome**: Identified open ports and services running on Metasploitable 2.

### Step 2: Vulnerability Assessment

- **Skills Gained**: Vulnerability identification, risk analysis.
- **Outcome**: Detailed list of vulnerabilities associated with identified services.

### Step 3: Risk Assessment

- **Skills Gained**: Risk assessment methodology, impact and likelihood analysis.
- **Outcome**: Assessment of risk levels for each identified vulnerability.

### Step 4: Mitigation and Treatment Plan

- **Skills Gained**: Development of mitigation strategies, application of security measures.
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive mitigation plan to address identified vulnerabilities.

### Step 5: Implementation and Monitoring

- **Skills Gained**: Implementation of security controls, continuous monitoring.
- **Outcome**: Implemented mitigation strategies and established a plan for ongoing monitoring and review.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in conducting a thorough risk assessment and developing a mitigation plan for a vulnerable system. By following the ISO 27001 framework, I demonstrated my ability to enhance security postures and protect information assets effectively. The skills and knowledge gained through this project are directly applicable to real-world cybersecurity challenges, making it a significant addition to my professional portfolio.
